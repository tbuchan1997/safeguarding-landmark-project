                        <p>Recognizing safeguarding concerns is essential for protecting individuals from harm. Signs of
                            abuse, neglect, or exploitation can be physical, emotional, or behavioral and may vary
                            depending
                            on the person's age or situation. Common indicators include unexplained injuries, changes in
                            behavior, withdrawal from social interactions, fearfulness, or a sudden decline in health or
                            hygiene.</p>
                        <p>It’s also important to look for signs of financial abuse, such as unusual bank activity or
                            unpaid
                            bills, and indicators of neglect, like poor living conditions or unmet medical needs. Trust
                            your
                            instincts—if something doesn’t seem right, it’s worth taking action. Early identification
                            and
                            reporting can make a crucial difference in preventing harm and ensuring individuals receive
                            the
                            support they need.</p>

                                        <li>Every organization should have a safeguarding policy that outlines the steps
                                            for reporting concerns. Follow these procedures, which usually involve
                                            informing a designated safeguarding officer (DSO) or lead.</li>
                                        <li>Provide all the details you have, including what you observed, what was

                                            is outside the organization’s remit, contact local safeguarding services
                                            directly. This might include social services, child protection teams, or

                                        <li>If you’re unsure where to report, consult local safeguarding guidance or a
