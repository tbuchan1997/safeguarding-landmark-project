                            Safeguarding is the process of protecting individuals, especially children, young people,
                            and
                            vulnerable adults, from abuse, harm, and neglect. It encompasses a range of measures
                            aimed at
                            ensuring their safety, well-being, and human rights are respected. This includes
                            preventing abuse
                            before it happens, responding effectively to incidents when they occur, and promoting a
                            culture of
                            safety in all settings.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Safeguarding is crucial because it helps create environments where individuals can live,
                            learn, and
                            grow without fear. It ensures that the most vulnerable members of society are protected
                            from harm
                            and can lead fulfilling lives. By understanding the signs of abuse, knowing how to
                            report concerns,
                            and implementing protective measures, we can work together to prevent harm and support
                            those who may
                            be at risk. Safeguarding is not just the responsibility of professionals; it is a shared
                            duty that
                            requires community awareness and proactive action.

                                    accountability. This principle involves making sure that everyone understands

                                    reviews, and adherence to safeguarding policies help maintain high standards and
