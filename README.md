## User Experience (UX)  
  
### **User Stories**  

As a user, I want to access a contact section with relevant details so that I can report safeguarding concerns quickly if needed.

As a user, I want to see a bold and clear introductory message so that I immediately understand the importance of safeguarding when I land on the page.

As a user, I want to quickly access key safeguarding principles so that I can understand what safeguarding involves and why it matters.

As a site owner, I want to present a hero section with a bold heading and a relevant image or background so that the website immediately captures the user's attention and communicates the significance of safeguarding.

As a user, I want to find a clear, step-by-step guide for recognizing and responding to safeguarding concerns so that I know what actions to take if I encounter a safeguarding issue.

As a user, I want a color-coded visual hierarchy for different sections so that it is easier to follow the flow of information.


### **Further UX Considerations**

#### **1. Navigation Simplicity**
- I intend to make the website with easy and intuitive navigation in mind. This is to ensure critical information can be found quickly without having to search around the website.
- The layout has been chosen to help users locate content efficiently.

#### **2. Responsive design**
-The site will be optimised and tested for different screen sizes and browsers, starting from mobile (320px) first. This is to ensure readability and functionality across mobile, tablet and desktops.

#### **3. Accessibility**

- Accessibility features such as image alt text and ARIA labels will be incorporated throughout the site.
-High contrast colour schemes and font sizing/family choices will enhance readability for visually impaired users.

#### **4. Content Clarity and Structure**

- The language used on this site will be clear and concise, which is important for conveying sensitive safeguarding information.
- Content will be organised to present essential information clearly, with images interspersed to avoid overwhelming the user with blocks of text.

#### **5. Feedback Mechanisms**

- Interactive elements, such as forms and call to action buttons allow users to interact and encourages communication.

#### **6. Consistency in Design**

- A consistent use of fonts, colours and visual hierarchy across all pages will help the user become familiar with the layout, reducing cognitive overload.
- This consistency aims to improve the UX by making navigation feel intuitive and predictable.

## **Creation process (Strategy -> Surface)**

### **1. Strategy**  


- I required an easy-to-read, dependable website that delivers clear information about safeguarding and reporting in a clear and user friendly way.  
- The website will be designed for mobile first (320px) and adjusted for key breakpoints for tablets, desktops and larger screens.
- Target users for the site will be educators, parents and community members including less tech-savvy users seeking guidance so that will be kept in mind when planning the colour scheme and layout for the site.
  

### **2. Scope**  

The Safeguarding information site must be available on a wide range of devices. 

- The site is to contain only relevant information, presented in a consistent fashion and layout.   
- Text must be clear, legible and high in contrast on any sized device to allow the user instant access to the menu, form and all information.  
- A brief introduction to the purpose of the website to be included in the landing page.
- Content will cover the 6 principles of safeguarding, how to identify a concern, how to report within your organisation, links to additional resources and a form for reporting a concern.
  

### **3. Structural**  

It was requested that the design was straightforward, clear and easy to understand with the following features:
 
- A hero section that quicky and clearly describe the purpose of the website.
- Key information sections to be included covering the 6 principles on the landing page
- A separate page with identifying and how to report
- Another page with additional resources 
- A form for reporting safeguarding concerns. 

There will be a navigation structure with clear labels always visible, and a footer with contact information and social links on every page.

  
### **4. Skeleton**  

The site was designed to be straightforward with details about safeguarding and reporting clearly signposted.  
 
- A four-item navigation bar of 'Home', 'Identify', 'Resources' and 'Report a Concern', will at the top of the screen. An enlarge feature identifying the current page and colour change whether a cursor or touch was accurate.  On smaller screens the menu collapses into an accordion.
- A large, clear image dominates the landing page. 
- Centred in the image is a blurb explaining the purpose of the website.
- Scrolling down the page introduces to slightly more in-depth overview of what safeguarding is.
- The page ends with the footer with contact details and social media links.
- For the contact page, the navigation bar and footer remain as before. There is a form with text, date, time inputs plus a dropdown menu and radio buttons.
- For the identify page, the navigation and footer remain as before. Two sections are presented with explanatory headings. Underneath is detailed information regarding basic safeguarding procedures
-The additional resources page has multiple cards to links to real organisations with blurb taken from their websites.

### Wireframes  

[Wireframes are available here](/docs/wireframes

### **5. Surface**  
 
- Two clean, sans-serif fonts, were used 'Lora' and 'Roboto'. Both of these are clear and nicely spaced making them readable for everyone.
- Two separate sites will be created for light and dark modes for the users preference, accessible from the navbar.


### **Design**
- Colour scheme for the site (initial palettes generated by chatGPT, specific colour tones amended to fit my preference). The text colour was chosen to provide sufficient context:

#### **Light Mode Palette**

| Purpose              | Colour       | Hex       | Usage                                           |
|----------------------|-------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary**          | Blue        | `#2A7EDE` | Buttons, links, and highlights                  |
| **Background**       | Off-White   | `#F9FAFB` | Main background for pages                       |
| **Text Primary**     | Dark Gray   | `#333333` | Main text colour                                 |
| **Secondary Accent** | Teal        | `#1B9A77` | Secondary buttons, icons, and emphasis elements |
| **Warning/Error**    | Orange-Red  | `#FF7043` | Alerts, warnings, and error messages            |

---

#### **Dark Mode Palette**

| Purpose              | Colour       | Hex       | Usage                                           |
|----------------------|-------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary**          | Light Blue  | `#42A5F5` | Buttons, links, and highlights                  |
| **Background**       | Dark Gray   | `#121212` | Main background for pages                       |
| **Text Primary**     | Light Gray  | `#E0E0E0` | Main text colour                                 |
| **Secondary Accent** | Aqua        | `#26C6DA` | Secondary buttons, icons, and emphasis elements |
| **Warning/Error**    | Light Red   | `#EF5350` | Alerts, warnings, and error messages            |

---

#### **Typography**

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to import the fonts 'Roboto' and 'Lora'. I used Lora for headings and Roboto for the main content.

---

#### **Imagery**

- I specifically chose to use AI generated images as a learning tool to help develop my prompting skills. The images are mainly there to texture the page and improving readability by breaking the text into more digestible blocks.

---

Overall, the design was intended and created to evoke a safe and professional environment.

## Tablet & Mobile View  
 
### **Desktop, Tablet & Mobile Differences**  

- To ensure responsivity I intend to use CSS flexbox and media queries to ensure responsivity across key breakpoints to ensure the site works on all screen sizes.

## **Testing**

## Basic Tests

| Test Category             | Description                                                             | Expected Outcome                                            | Successful? |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Navigation**            | Verify that all menu links and buttons navigate to the correct pages.   | All links and buttons should direct to the intended pages.  |             |
| **Responsiveness**        | Check the layout on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).     | Layout should adjust properly on all devices and screen sizes. |             |
| **Accessibility**         | Test keyboard navigation for all interactive elements.                  | Users should be able to navigate using only the keyboard.   |             |
| **Colour Contrast**        | Ensure text has high contrast against background colours.                | Text should be legible, meeting WCAG contrast guidelines.   |             |
| **Image Alt Text**        | Verify that all images have descriptive alt text for screen readers.    | Alt text should describe images meaningfully for users with visual impairments. |             |
| **Form Validation**       | Check form inputs for required fields and proper error messages.        | Forms should provide clear error messages for invalid input. |             |
| **Performance**           | Measure page load speed and ensure media loads efficiently.             | Pages should load quickly, and images should not delay rendering. |             |
| **Link Accessibility**    | Ensure all links have meaningful text for screen readers.               | Links should be descriptive (no "click here" or "read more"). |             |
| **Browser Compatibility** | Test site on popular browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).          | Site should display correctly and function as expected on all tested browsers. |             |
| **Security**              | Verify HTTPS is active, and sensitive data (if any) is secure.          | Site should use HTTPS, and sensitive information should be protected. |             |
| **Content Consistency**   | Review site for consistent fonts, colours, and layout across pages.      | All pages should maintain a uniform look and feel.          |             |

## Deployment

### **How to deploy**  

GitHub was used to deploy the website. These were the steps taken to acheive this:  

1. Login to GitHub account
2. Navigate to the project repository, safeguarding-project
3. Click the Settings button near the top of the page
4. In the left-hand menu, find and click on the Pages button
5. In the Source section, choose 'main' from the drop-down, select branch menu
6. Select 'root' from the drop-down folder menu
7. Click 'Save' and after a few moments the project will have been made live and a link is visible at the top of the page


### **Initial testing plan**

I planned for this site to be accessible and legible on all screen sizes. I will use Chrome Dev Tools to test, adjust and debug in the early stages.

### **Testing**    

Testing took place throughout the entire build using Dev Tools on Firefox and on several real-world devices available for simulation on devTools.

### **Learning Points** 

#### **Use of AI**

I tried to use AI to generate html and css on the procedures page, but the choice in classes used were very counterintuitive and hard to manage adapting the CSS for breakpoints and responsiveness so I ended up rewriting the majority of the code. In future I will primarily use AI for generating the more tedious/repetitive code to write manually (such as lists and forms), but maintain classes and IDs by myself to make CSS styling easier.

I did use AI to good effect in generating the form elements in the report page, but I limited it to html only and I subsequently went through and styled myself.

#### **What Went Well & Even Better If**
##### **WWW**
- The website does what I intended, is clear and intuitive.
- The colour scheme is understated and matches the vibe of the site.
- The form section was a really effective use of AI.

##### **EBI**
- Use AI more efficiently - Generate feature templates with AI (e.g. navbars, forms etc) and adjust to how I want them.
- Good enough is good enough - Lost too much time styling the navbar and footer trying to make them perfect (which they aren't) before moving on - had to rush parts later on.
- Make the project manageable - Overcommitted content wise and should have hit the key assessment points very well, then moved onto nice-to-haves. Plan basic page structure and classes/IDs in more detail to help with CSS.
